# MATLAB-Tools
A set of scripts produced for MATLAB which may be useful within your own projects and files.


Usage information is found in the comments at the top of each file

There are currently 3 main scripts:

1. GraphTitles - add a titles and axis labels as well as font sizes in one command
2. SaveFigure - save the specified figure with a specified aspect ratio
3. FoldDataGUI - fold a set of input data to calculate the periodicity of the data. This script uses FoldData but should be called first
