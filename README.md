# MATLAB-Tools
A set of scripts produced for MATLAB which may be useful within your own projects and files.
The most useful scripts are `GraphTitles` and `SaveFigure`. `FoldData` was produced from some code I wrote for the Cepheid Variables experiment in second year labs.

**Warning:** If you are using this code, do not use/include it in anything that is submitted through Turnitin, some of this code may have already been uploaded and as a result, it will be marked as plagiarised.

Usage information is found in the comments at the top of each file.

There are currently 3 main scripts:

1. `GraphTitles` - add a titles and axis labels as well as font sizes in one command
2. `SaveFigure` - save the specified figure with a specified aspect ratio
3. `FoldData` - fold a set of input data to calculate the periodicity of the data
